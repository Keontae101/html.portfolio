<h1>The Best Movies according to Toot</h1>
<h2>My top three favorite movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</h3>
<p>
  One of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movies and a big blockbluster classic. A
  legendary soundtrack and an all too familar theme of humaninty and our will to
  survive.
</p>

<h3>Avenger's Infinty War</h3>
<p>
  A marvel classic, the culmination of every movie before it that showed that
  comic book movies can be absurd and reasonable with thoughtprovoking questions
  and villians just like any other genre.
</p>

<h3>Intersteller</h3>
<p>
  Another space classic with a fantasic musical score and beautiful
  cineamtography.
