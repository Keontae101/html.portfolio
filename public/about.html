<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm new to web development and I've decided to learn this craft in hopes of
  one day making my own solo SaSS bussinesses.
</p>

<h2>Where am I from</h2>
<p>
  I'm from a small town in Norway called Lexington. It's quiet, relativley off
  the grid, and not many people know about it.
</p>

<h2>Why did I take an intrest into software development</h2>
<p>
  I always liked creating things as a child but lacked artistic skill. My hand
  to eye coordination was very poor but I could always type on a keyboard faster
  than others so this proved to be the perfect medium!
